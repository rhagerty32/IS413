<p>Spikeball is a high-energy sport that blends elements of volleyball and handball. Played with a small, circular net set at ankle level, teams of two take turns hitting a small ball off the net, aiming to outmaneuver their opponents. It requires quick reflexes, teamwork, and strategic placement of the ball to score points.</p>
<p>The game is played to 21 points, with teams alternating serves every two points. The sport is easy to learn but offers plenty of depth for competitive play. Whether at the beach, park, or backyard, Spikeball is a great way to stay active and have fun!</p>
